                        My name is Jack Ashburn. I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Colorado at 
                        Boulder, where I'm majoring in Computer Science and working in a Space minor. 
                        <br><br>
                        I'm looking for a full time position after graduating in May 2023, and am hoping to work in Colorado (physically or remotely). 
                        I have experience with several languages through the CU Boulder computer science program and some tools through professional experience.
                        I have practice with GitHub, VisualStudio, LaTeX, and Blender. I have worked with C, C++, Scala, HTML, Python, and JavaScript, as well as a hanfdul of libraries such as Three.js and Bootstrap.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of the workplace, I enjoy playing video and board games with my friends, going on hikes, and snowboarding. My favorite games include Settlers 
                        of Catan, Munchkin, and poker (which I am not very good at). I knew I wanted to 
                        go into computer science after taking a high school elective on java and recreating asteriods. Seeing a project like that
                        come to fruition is what keeps me in front of the keyboard.
